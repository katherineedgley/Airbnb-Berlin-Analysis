## Installation and Data
Requires Python versions 3.\*. May require installing plotly, stats models, folium, and guppy, if not already installed.
The data is also accessible [here](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) under Berlin, Berlin, Germany for the month of March 2020. To run the notebook, titled ``Airbnb_Berlin.ipynb``, you will need to unzip the following files located in the data folder: ``listings.csv.gz`` and ``reviews.csv.gz``.

## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in exploring and analyzing current Airbnb data in the city of Berlin. The code addresses the following questions:\
	1.	What proportion of Airbnb hosts in Berlin likely use hosting as a primary source of income (or are businesses)? \
	2.	How does the price of an Airbnb differ throughout neighborhoods in Berlin, and what neighborhoods are the best value for money? \
	3.	Can we predict the location rating for a listing, and what neighborhoods have the greatest influence on those ratings?

## File Descriptions
The notebook, ``Airbnb_Berlin.ipynb``, contains the final code used to answer these questions, in addition to some extra analysis. Markdown cells will guide readers through the notebook, which generally follows the CRISP-DM process. 

## Results
The findings from this exploratory analysis as well as prediction can be found in [this Medium post](https://medium.com/@katherineedgley/a-visual-data-driven-look-at-airbnb-hosting-in-berlin-729eccd8bf9d) I wrote to explain the study.
